# Clementine.js Beginner Tutorial
This repository is a walk-through of the [Clementine.js Beginner
Tutorial](http://www.clementinejs.com/tutorials/tutorial-beginner.html).

My main purpose for this repository is to learn how to build a full-script
JavaScript application.

This is being done as part of the [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)
tutorial.
